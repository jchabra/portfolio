            <li>Come with a specific list of features - what I am showing in my Axure Prototype is a lot and I should probably narrow it down. </li>
            <li>Go to places that are listed as accessible on Google Maps (or Yelp) and see if they are actually accessible. </li>

          <h2>This Past Week</h2>
          <p>I was out of town over the weekend, but during my free time, I spent some time brainstorming the list of features I'd like to include in my application. To do that, I wanted to review the different datasets that are available. The data is the most important part of my application - the data should include the accessible locations and then I’ll use the Google Maps API to create the guided “accessible” route.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I reviewed the Access Earth API - It isn’t very large; 4828 data sets total; out of those 788 are for the state of New York.</li>
            <li>Google Maps API: I spent some time trying to understand the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Maps API (JS)</a></li>
            <li>I came across this as well: <a href="https://news.wheelmap.org/en/faq/" target="_blank">wheelmap.org</a>. I have not reviewed the API/data sets on this site yet, but I will take a look in the next few days. I think I will be relying mostly on the Access Earth API and the Google Maps API.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Features Brainstorm</h3>
          <p>I drew a mindmap to brainstorm the list of features I would like to have in my app. Since developing ALL of the features for this app is not feasible in one semester (~ a month), I have decided to narrow it down. For version 1, I want to include:</p>
          <div class="grid-50 mobile-grid-100">
            <ul>
              <li>Start with just accessible restaurants (the other options: shopping, coffee, etc. can be added later)</li>
              <li>The step-by-step guided route will provide directions using the Google Maps API and show accessible entrances.</li>
              <li>The favorites option will be a "nice to have" and something I will include if there is time, but most likely it will be added to version 2.</li>
              <li>Finally, the "itinerary" seemed like an important feature based on feedback from my pre-thesis final presentation. So, I would really like to include this if it’s not too complicated to develop.</li>
            </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>I am scheduled to meet my thesis advisor, Claire, on Monday (2/13). There I want to review the features I plan on building in my app and my timeline, and discuss how to get users.</li>
            <li>How does PhoneGap work?</li>

          <h2>This Past Week</h2>
          <p>This past week, I spent some time reviewing my pre-thesis research and pre-thesis final project. I began to list out the different features that I want in the app. As it stands, the app is too broad. Ideally, I’d like for it to be global, but that’s too much to complete in one semester. So, I am thinking about just focusing on NYC and may even narrow it down even further – maybe just a borough (something I will be discussing with my thesis advisor next week). 
            <br><br>

            Since I have front-end development experience, I am not too worried about creating the application, but I have minimal experience building databases. Finding/acquiring accurate datasets and building the database will be my biggest coding challenge for this project. However, the thing I will probably struggle with the most is writing the thesis paper. I am glad that we have very specific deadlines for writing this semester. It is definitely something I would have neglected otherwise. 
          </p>

          <div class="grid-70 mobile-grid-100 paddingZero">
            <h2>What is your research question?</h2>
            <p>How can we empower people with disabilities to go out and explore new places in NYC?</p>

            <h2>What is the context?</h2>
            <p>The Let’s Go application will be a digital tool that will provide accessible information in one central location that allows a person with a disability to plan out their day with detailed manageable and accessible navigation, activities and events. This information is often not easily available in one central place. Hence, this one application will enable people with disabilities to do the activities they want to do more efficiently. More importantly, this application will be created with an “accessibility-first” design mindset.</p>

            <h2>How will you achieve this project by the end of April?</h2>
            <p>I have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/142MeVaJ1go9HXPdmXRUK7yoeJhViw0IUUGvCHiDmF8A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project timeline</a> that will be regularly updated. I also have a Trello board that I will be using for specific development tasks, user research and user testing.</p>
            <p>Here is a rough timeline:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Jan 25th - Feb 1st:</b> Review of Pre-Thesis Research and Project</li>
                <li><b>Feb 2nd - Feb 8th:</b> Come up with milestones and tasks for the final project. </li>
                <li><b>Feb 2nd - Feb 10th:</b> Additional research - speak to users, reading, database development</li>
                <li><b>Feb 11th - Feb 25th:</b> Coding/development, iterations, additional research and writing outline</li>
                <li><b>Feb 26th - March 5th:</b> Iterations based on user feedback &amp;  advisor feedback; Redrafting paper outline</li>
                <li><b>March 5th - March 8th:</b> Final touch-ups on app and prepare for Science Fair Demo</li>
                <li><b>March 11th - March 19th:</b> User Testing/Iterations</li>
                <li><b>March 20th - March 29th:</b> Iterations based on user feedback; draft results</li>
                <li><b>March 30th - April 5th:</b> Prep for Mock Presentations; additional iterations of app; Paper revisions</li>
                <li><b>April 6th - April 26th:</b> Paper revisions; Prep for Mock Presentations</li>
                <li><b>April 27th - May ?:</b> Thesis Defense Prep</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="clear"></div>
          Next Steps (for now):
          <ul>
            <li>Finish compiling the list of features and break them down into tasks (Trello)</li>
            <li>The app needs to be accessible to all people with a disability. I will refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and 508 compliance guidelines while I am developing my project. I need to include the guidelines as part of my development tasks.</li>
            <li>With the help of my thesis advisor, I will speak to more users (for additional research)</li>
            <li>Research and speak to my advisor about getting accurate datasets for my database (i.e. Google Maps API, <a href="http://www.accesstogether.org/" target="_blank">Access Together’s API</a>, etc.)</li>
            <li>Schedule weekly meetings with my accountability partner</li>
          </ul>
