            <h2>This Past Week</h2>
            <p>I spent the last week coding and really hashing out the user flow of my application. I slowed down a bit during the weekend because I caught a cold. Now I am in crunch mode since our demo day is just a week away!</p>
            <p>Even though I have narrowed down (on paper) the limited features I need to build to have an MVP, I have a feeling I will have to slim it down even more. Although I have programming knowledge and experience, some of the features are outside of my programming skills. Even though there is a lot of documentation online on developing an application like this, time will always be an issue. The reality is that I can spend a year working on this on my own, but I need to be mindful of time and focus on developing a functioning application that will be able to provide the basic features so that it can be user tested.</p>
            <p>Since I am developing a limited number of features, as I am coding, I am trying to come up with "tasks" I will be asking my users to complete when they are testing my product.</p>

          <h3>Reading and Research</h3>
          <p>I did a lot of reading and research last semester, but I feel like I need more qualitative data to back up some of my claims (i.e. All of the benefits that these web/mobile applications have created have made minimal improvements for people with disabilities.). Although this is something we all "know", it would be great to back up something like that with data/numbers. I still haven't found anything that's worth using in my paper.</p>

            <h2>This Past Week</h2>
            <h3>Just do it. Just start coding it.</h3>
            <p>This past week, I have been going back and forth with my thesis advisor refining my checklist to collect "accurate" data. I realized that the process of collecting data was going to be more time consuming than I had anticipated. So, I decided that instead of spending time collecting data (right now), I was going to start coding the app and use fake data. If between now and the demo day (2 weeks from today!!), I have time to collect data, I will update the app with the new data. In the meantime, I think it's more important for me to have a working app. I can focus on collecting data after the demo day (prior to user testing).</p>
            <p>Kate's advice to me last week was, "Just do it. Just start coding it."</p>
            <p>So... I began coding my Let's Go Mobile Application!  <a href="https://github.com/jchabra/letsgo" target="_blank">Here is a link to my Github repo.</a></p>

            <p><b>*Side note:</b> I spoke to a friend who has two young children (a 2.5 year old and a 1 year old) and she said that she often struggles to find a route in NYC that is accessible to her with a stroller. She has to map out her route and get off at a subway stop that has an elevator and hope that the elevator is working. She was excited to hear that I am planning to create this app - something that will map out a route for her and make it easier for her to take her kids around the city.
              <br> [Did you know that there is no elevator at the Central Park Zoo subway stop?]</p>

              <h3>Paper Outline</h3>

              <p>I also started my paper outline. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/document/d/1dQSZHzAVwoQ5T2WRh0ZwFORVCbPdASZzIdsPgppVFhk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a link to my Paper Outline #1.</a></p>

            <h2>This Past Week</h2>
            <p>Last week, I had a 1on1 meeting with Gwen. There I was able to talk through the steps of the features I had narrowed down. It was really helpful! We talked about what information I needed to build each feature and what are the most important aspects of those features. Although I tried doing that on my own, but having another person to talk to was really helpful. She suggested things that I hadn’t even thought about. </p>
            <p>I met with my thesis advisor, Claire. Her insights are always extremely useful:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Data Sets:</b> Claire believes that it’s really hard to get accurate data and that most datasets about accessible places tend to be false. She suggested that I spend a day going to locations around a specific area (potentially where I will be user testing my product) and come up with my own data. If I have about 20 to begin with, it should be enough to get a working demo.</li>
              <li><b>Checklist:</b> One of the most important parts of my application is the ability to filter locations based on specific needs of the user. Claire suggested that I use my main user, my mom, and create a checklist based on her needs. I can use this checklist to build my database as well as create a list of filters. It's important to note that this "checklist" will continue to evolve. </li>
              <li><b>Users:</b> Since my mom cannot be only user, she offered to reach out to the <a href="http://www.ucpnyc.org/" target="_blank">United Cerebral Palsy Organization of NYC</a>. I will collect data near their offices in NYC so that the users can use that area when testing my product.</li>
              <li><b>PhoneGap:</b> Claire connected me to a professor at ITP who teaches how to develop iOS and Android PhoneGap mobile applications. Although I have already gone through some PhoneGap tutorials, having a resource that will help me when I get stuck is going to be really useful.</li>
              <li><b>Waze Model: </b>The ideal version of this app would include a Waze model of crowdsourcing. A single place cannot stay “accessible” forever – things change; like, construction, weather, places come and go, etc. So, if people can help modify the database as they travel, that will help build a better database. However, developing that feature will require a lot time and, potentially, additional resources (a.k.a. more developers). So, Claire suggested that in the first version of this app, there could be an option where the user can send me an email to update the information. Then I can continue to build the app to include the Waze model.</li>
              <li><b>Itinerary Feature: </b>A feature that I did not build in my pre-thesis final prototype was the “itinerary” feature, but the feedback I received was that this feature could possibly be one of the most important features of this application. Often times, there is a lot of planning involved for a person with a disability to go to a specific place. Claire suggested that to create a minimum viable product including this feature could involve the user simply saving the itinerary to their calendar (iphone, google, etc.). Once it’s saved to their calendar, they can share their itinerary with other people (by “inviting” other attendees).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="grid-60 mobile-grid-100">
              <p>Using Claire’s advice, I spoke to my mom to get an understanding of what her specific needs are when she is going to a specific place. This is what I have narrowed it down to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Ramps: </b>Are ramps available? Is it steep? Does the ramp have railings?</li>
                <li><b>Doors: </b>What type of door? Automatic? Push/pull? Sliding? Revolving? Is it heavy? Is it too hard to open for an able-bodied person? Is there a handicap accessible push button?</li>
                <li><b>Handicap Accessible Bathrooms: </b>Number of stalls? Location of the stall (i.e. in the back)? Toilet height? Railings? Automatic flush?</li>
                <li><b>Aisles/Space: </b> If it's a restaurant, are the aisles wide enough to maneuver a walker/wheelchair?</li>
                <li><b>Floor: </b> Is it easy to walk on? Is it slippery? Is it carpeted?</li>
                <li><b>Handicap Parking Spots: </b> How many are there? Are they close to the location you are trying to go to?</li>
                <li><b>Elevator Access:</b> Is there elevator access? Is it easy to get to the elevator?</li>
                <li><b>Stairs (non-wheelchair user):</b> Do the stairs have railings?</li>
              </ol>

              <li>If using the Waze Model for crowd-sourcing, ask the user questions as they go along - What is the door like? Is there a handicap accessible button? Is the elevator working at this subway stop? Etc.</li>
              <li>Come with a specific list of features - what I am showing in my Axure Prototype is a lot and I should probably narrow it down. </li>
              <li>Go to places that are listed as accessible on Google Maps (or Yelp) and see if they are actually accessible. </li>

            <h2>This Past Week</h2>
            <p>I was out of town over the weekend, but during my free time, I spent some time brainstorming the list of features I'd like to include in my application. To do that, I wanted to review the different datasets that are available. The data is the most important part of my application - the data should include the accessible locations and then I’ll use the Google Maps API to create the guided “accessible” route.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I reviewed the Access Earth API - It isn’t very large; 4828 data sets total; out of those 788 are for the state of New York.</li>
              <li>Google Maps API: I spent some time trying to understand the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Maps API (JS)</a></li>
              <li>I came across this as well: <a href="https://news.wheelmap.org/en/faq/" target="_blank">wheelmap.org</a>. I have not reviewed the API/data sets on this site yet, but I will take a look in the next few days. I think I will be relying mostly on the Access Earth API and the Google Maps API.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Features Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>I drew a mindmap to brainstorm the list of features I would like to have in my app. Since developing ALL of the features for this app is not feasible in one semester (~ a month), I have decided to narrow it down. For version 1, I want to include:</p>
            <div class="grid-50 mobile-grid-100">
              <ul>
                <li>Start with just accessible restaurants (the other options: shopping, coffee, etc. can be added later)</li>
                <li>The step-by-step guided route will provide directions using the Google Maps API and show accessible entrances.</li>
                <li>The favorites option will be a "nice to have" and something I will include if there is time, but most likely it will be added to version 2.</li>
                <li>Finally, the "itinerary" seemed like an important feature based on feedback from my pre-thesis final presentation. So, I would really like to include this if it’s not too complicated to develop.</li>

            <h2>This Past Week</h2>
            <p>This past week, I spent some time reviewing my pre-thesis research and pre-thesis final project. I began to list out the different features that I want in the app. As it stands, the app is too broad. Ideally, I’d like for it to be global, but that’s too much to complete in one semester. So, I am thinking about just focusing on NYC and may even narrow it down even further – maybe just a borough (something I will be discussing with my thesis advisor next week). 
              <br><br>

              Since I have front-end development experience, I am not too worried about creating the application, but I have minimal experience building databases. Finding/acquiring accurate datasets and building the database will be my biggest coding challenge for this project. However, the thing I will probably struggle with the most is writing the thesis paper. I am glad that we have very specific deadlines for writing this semester. It is definitely something I would have neglected otherwise. 
            </p>

            <div class="grid-70 mobile-grid-100 paddingZero">
              <h2>What is your research question?</h2>
              <p>How can we empower people with disabilities to go out and explore new places in NYC?</p>

              <h2>What is the context?</h2>
              <p>The Let’s Go application will be a digital tool that will provide accessible information in one central location that allows a person with a disability to plan out their day with detailed manageable and accessible navigation, activities and events. This information is often not easily available in one central place. Hence, this one application will enable people with disabilities to do the activities they want to do more efficiently. More importantly, this application will be created with an “accessibility-first” design mindset.</p>

              <h2>How will you achieve this project by the end of April?</h2>
              <p>I have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/142MeVaJ1go9HXPdmXRUK7yoeJhViw0IUUGvCHiDmF8A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project timeline</a> that will be regularly updated.
