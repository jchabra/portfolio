          <h2>This Past Week</h2>
         <p>I iterated my design based on the first group of usability testing and then I tested again with 2 more people at the end of last week. Based on the feedback from my second usability testing, I have created a final iteration of my prototype (that will not be changed again for thesis). Here was some of the user feedback from the 2nd round of usability testing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All the buttons and fonts need to be larger</li>
            <li>There needs to be more on-boarding information to understand what the user needs to do on the preference/account page</li>
            <li>Confirmation that the elevator is working at the subway station</li>
            <li>Location of boarding area at subway station</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The rest of my time has been spent on writing. And I am officially scheduled to defend my thesis on May 2nd. </p>

         <h2>This Past Week</h2>
         <p>I had a call with Jason DaSilva, the creator of <a href="http://www.axsmap.com/" target="_blank">AXS Map</a>. The interview was really interesting. He mostly talked business and not why he started it. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_DaSilva" target="_blank">my research</a> and talking to other people who know him, he was diagnosed with primary progressive MS in his twenties. He said he created AXS Map in 2010. He explained the logistics of how he created it and the criteria for rating as well as crowdsourcing the information. He said that it was challenging getting people to submit reviews and initially he was only able to collect 30,000 reviews. Then for the past year he worked with places that are ADA certified and got automatic reviews on AXS maps. That led to a jump of about 540,000 places reviewed globally. I asked how he determines whether or not the places are accurate and he said that there is no real way to know that; however, they allow people to flag reviews that they might not feel is correct. He is in the process of releasing an API in the next few weeks. I think that will be a great place to start for me when developing the backend of this application. </p>

          <h3>Usability Testing Testing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I tried to user test on the street with able-bodied people in a wheelchair, but it didn’t really make sense since it wasn’t coded and couldn’t tell the person their exact location. Without geolocation, the person had to manually click through the route. There was no real benefit of doing it that way. </li>
            <li>I did usability testing with my updated Axure Prototype with 7 people; 5 of them were people with mobility impairments and 2 of them are people who play the role of an “aid” and assist people with mobility impairments</li>
            <li>I am scheduled to do usability testing with 2 more people tomorrow (Thursday) with an updated version of my prototype (iterated version)</li>

          <h3>Iteration</h3>
          <p>I am making quick changes to the user interface based on the feedback I received on Monday. </p>
          <h3>External &amp; Writing</h3>
          <p>I had a meeting with, <a href="http://www.icsny.org/meet-dots-quemuel-arroyo/" target="_blank">Quemuel Arroyo</a> to get some feedback and to see if he would be interested in being my external. He was great! The projects he is working on are super interesting and he seems really interested in my project. Oh, and he agreed to be my external!</p>
          <p>And of course, I’ve been writing. </p>

         <h3>User Testing</h3>
         <div class="grid-60 mobile-grid-100">
           <p>The Outreach Director at Adapt Network (UCP) has been really great and he’s been working on getting me potential users to test my prototype. It hasn’t been the easiest to find people in my very specific demographic who are willing to make the time to participate. As a result, I decided to offer an incentive for participating (a $15 Amazon Gift card). Instead of exclusively depending on the Adapt Network, I began reaching out to other people and organizations as well to see if I can find potential users. My goal is to get <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/" target="_blank"><b>5-8 users</b></a>.</p>
           <p>To get users, I spoke to:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>A professor at NYU who works with people with disabilities</li>
             <li>A volunteer at the Cerebral Palsy Foundation (different from the UCP) Young Professionals Committee</li>
             <li>A phd student and researcher at the Center for Cerebral Palsy Research at Columbia University</li>
             <li>A family friend who has relapsing-remitting MS that is really involved of the National MS Society</li>
             <li>A Social Worker at the Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center at NYU Langone</li>
             <li>A Social Worker at the International Multiple Sclerosis Management Practice (IMSMP) (also called the Tisch MS Research Center of New York)</li>
             <li>And I have sent many “cold” emails to other people and organizations asking for advice/help/guidance</li>
             <li>I am scheduled to speak to Jason DaSilva (the creator of AXS Map) this week</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Most, if not all, people that I spoke to were excited about the project and interested in helping out. However, after a great phone conversation and a follow-up email from me, it’s been radio silence. I am assuming that they are trying to contact people who will be willing to participate in my usability test. In the meantime, I am doing some user testing with able-bodied people in electric wheelchairs. </p>

          <h3>Thesis Paper</h3>
          <p>I also spent some time writing the paper. We created an outline in class last week that was really helpful. It was easier to fit my content into that outline so that my information would flow. </p>
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>I am planning a usability test day with potential users for Monday (4/10) at the UCP in Brooklyn - the details are still being hashed out (keeping my fingers crossed that this works out). I will be doing user testing with a few able-bodied people in the next couple of days. And, most importantly, I will keep writing! </p>

       <h2>This Past Week</h2>
       <p>My focus changed a bit since last week. After a conversation with Kate, we decided that it didn’t make sense for me to kill myself coding the backend. So, instead, I have created a detailed step-by-step prototype that has one route that the user will follow. Along with the prototype, I have been trying to set up user testing. The UCP has been really helpful and they told me that they have potentially 20-25 people interested in testing the prototype. However, based on a conversation I had with the Outreach Director, it sounded like most of them either don’t own smartphones or don’t have the motor skills to use one. As a result, my target audience has become more specific. This application is for people with mobility impairments that use (own) a smartphone. It would also be great if they currently use or have used navigation apps (like google maps) to get around. </p>
       <p>In addition, I met with my thesis advisor, Claire, and we came up with a plan for user testing and began discussing potential options for an external advisor. We haven’t settled on an external yet, but it’s work in progress.</p>
       <p>Along with setting up my user testing, I have been doing additional research and updating my outline for my paper.</p>

        <h2>Feedback from Demo Day (on March 8th)</h2>
        <p>We had our Demo Day the week before spring break. The feedback I received was extremely useful. Getting a complete outside perspective was really great. Here is the feedback I received:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Filters:</b> Put all filters on the “account” page or “user profile” page. Most likely the user’s requirements will not change daily. Have the user select their “needs” for the customized route when they set up their account. Then they can go back and change/add/remove filter options in the account page. The route should automatically search every time based on those options. This way the user doesn’t have to select the filters every time they search.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make filters easier to understand. A few people didn’t understand what the difference between “shortest walk” and “distance” was. Also, instead of the heading “filters”, make it a question or a statement - for example, “What do you need?"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Geolocation:</b> When typing in a specific place to go (just using the app for navigation purposes), it should immediately show a geolocation map. That’s standard in maps applications and it’s what the user is looking for.</li>
          <li><b>Fonts:</b> make the fonts even bigger</li>
          <li><b>Additional Features: </b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Maybe show the “traffic” at subway/bus stops - a “rush hour” feature. </li>
            <li>When searching for a new destination (restaurant, shopping, etc.), when the user clicks on the button, it should immediately show a list of places near by based on the filtered/customized “needs” &rarr; “this place has 6 out of 8 of your filter options” (or something like that)</li>

        <h2>The Last Two Weeks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Interview with Community Outreach Director at UCP: </b> I spoke to someone at <a href="www.adaptcommunitynetwork.org/" target="_blank">Adapt Community Network</a> (formerly the United Cerebral Palsy of New York City). His feedback was amazing! He confirmed a lot of my assumptions and original research, but then I learned a lot of new things as well. Here are <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/document/d/1T9-rG5eBjLH_Ic426BztmhDXERGbWlOxEWD4rlP6_zo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">my notes</a> from that meeting.</li>
          <li><b>Survey:</b> I created a pre-user testing survey. The survey asks questions about navigating around New York City with a disability. I passed the survey on to the director at UCP to have him pass it around to people who live/work in or around NYC. I am trying to figure out who else I could send it to. I thought about it posting it online somewhere, but my users are so specific that I don’t want just anyone to take the survey and skew the results. I would love some suggestions! </li>
          <li><b>User Testing:</b> I didn’t start user testing because my entire user flow of my app is changing. I am still struggling with coding the backend and struggling with finding someone to help me. My goal is to have an MVP of some sort by the end of this coming weekend (I am going to speak to my thesis advisor for advice on what to do) so that I can user test next week with users from the Adapt Community Network. </li>
          <li><b>User Flows: </b>I have updated the user flow of my app based on the feedback I received from Demo Day.</li>
          <li><b>Paper Prototype/Wireframes:</b> I created paper wireframes for the new user flow. It’s easier for me to put things down on paper first before I start designing/coding. So, now I am coding the new version. </li>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <p>This past week was crunch time for developing my demo for the science fair. I spent a lot of time trying to make the Google Maps API to work - with no luck. So, I decided to embed a custom map, but even that resulted in a lot of sweat and tears (refer to the image :-) ). Eventually, I stopped and realized I just need to have an MVP that can complete at least one task within the userflow. I think I got to where I want it to be at least for this demo. I will have to do some more debugging (probably with some help) to get a better functioning app for user testing.</p>
        <p>I spent the entire week coding, but I was able to schedule a meeting with my thesis advisor to talk about next steps and additional research. Based on our conversation, my next steps are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure the app is "user-testable"</li>
          <li>Collect additional data for accessible places</li>
          <li>Begin User Testing</li>
          <li>Create surveys for pre and post user testing</li>
          <li>Possible expert interviews (staff at UCP, MTA Transit Museum, etc.)</li>
          <li>Update paper outline</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Claim Statement:</h3>
        <p>I am developing a navigation application to address a lack of information on accessible places and accessible routes for people with mobility impairments. <br> I think using this applicaiton will lead to empowerment for the user and that's important because it will provide (a sense of) independence.</p>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <p>I spent the last week coding and really hashing out the user flow of my application. I slowed down a bit during the weekend because I caught a cold. Now I am in crunch mode since our demo day is just a week away!</p>
        <p>Even though I have narrowed down (on paper) the limited features I need to build to have an MVP, I have a feeling I will have to slim it down even more. Although I have programming knowledge and experience, some of the features are outside of my programming skills. Even though there is a lot of documentation online on developing an application like this, time will always be an issue. The reality is that I can spend a year working on this on my own, but I need to be mindful of time and focus on developing a functioning application that will be able to provide the basic features so that it can be user tested.</p>
        <p>Since I am developing a limited number of features, as I am coding, I am trying to come up with "tasks" I will be asking my users to complete when they are testing my product.</p>

Although this is something we all "know", it would be great to back up something like that with data/numbers. I still haven't found anything that's worth using in my paper.</p>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <h3>Just do it. Just start coding it.</h3>
        <p>This past week, I have been going back and forth with my thesis advisor refining my checklist to collect "accurate" data. I realized that the process of collecting data was going to be more time consuming than I had anticipated. So, I decided that instead of spending time collecting data (right now), I was going to start coding the app and use fake data. If between now and the demo day (2 weeks from today!!), I have time to collect data, I will update the app with the new data. In the meantime, I think it's more important for me to have a working app. I can focus on collecting data after the demo day (prior to user testing).</p>
        <p>Kate's advice to me last week was, "Just do it. Just start coding it."</p>
        <p>So... I began coding my Let's Go Mobile Application!  <a href="https://github.com/jchabra/letsgo" target="_blank">Here is a link to my Github repo.</a></p>

        <p><b>*Side note:</b> I spoke to a friend who has two young children (a 2.5 year old and a 1 year old) and she said that she often struggles to find a route in NYC that is accessible to her with a stroller. She has to map out her route and get off at a subway stop that has an elevator and hope that the elevator is working. She was excited to hear that I am planning to create this app - something that will map out a route for her and make it easier for her to take her kids around the city.
          <br> [Did you know that there is no elevator at the Central Park Zoo subway stop?]</p>

          <h3>Paper Outline</h3>

          <p>I also started my paper outline. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/document/d/1dQSZHzAVwoQ5T2WRh0ZwFORVCbPdASZzIdsPgppVFhk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a link to my Paper Outline #1.</a></p>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <p>Last week, I had a 1on1 meeting with Gwen. There I was able to talk through the steps of the features I had narrowed down. It was really helpful! We talked about what information I needed to build each feature and what are the most important aspects of those features. Although I tried doing that on my own, but having another person to talk to was really helpful. She suggested things that I hadn’t even thought about. </p>
        <p>I met with my thesis advisor, Claire. Her insights are always extremely useful:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Data Sets:</b> Claire believes that it’s really hard to get accurate data and that most datasets about accessible places tend to be false. She suggested that I spend a day going to locations around a specific area (potentially where I will be user testing my product) and come up with my own data. If I have about 20 to begin with, it should be enough to get a working demo.</li>
          <li><b>Checklist:</b> One of the most important parts of my application is the ability to filter locations based on specific needs of the user. Claire suggested that I use my main user, my mom, and create a checklist based on her needs. I can use this checklist to build my database as well as create a list of filters. It's important to note that this "checklist" will continue to evolve. </li>
          <li><b>Users:</b> Since my mom cannot be only user, she offered to reach out to the <a href="http://www.ucpnyc.org/" target="_blank">United Cerebral Palsy Organization of NYC</a>. I will collect data near their offices in NYC so that the users can use that area when testing my product.</li>
          <li><b>PhoneGap:</b> Claire connected me to a professor at ITP who teaches how to develop iOS and Android PhoneGap mobile applications. Although I have already gone through some PhoneGap tutorials, having a resource that will help me when I get stuck is going to be really useful.</li>
          <li><b>Waze Model: </b>The ideal version of this app would include a Waze model of crowdsourcing. A single place cannot stay “accessible” forever – things change; like, construction, weather, places come and go, etc. So, if people can help modify the database as they travel, that will help build a better database. However, developing that feature will require a lot time and, potentially, additional resources (a.k.a. more developers). So, Claire suggested that in the first version of this app, there could be an option where the user can send me an email to update the information. Then I can continue to build the app to include the Waze model.</li>
          <li><b>Itinerary Feature: </b>A feature that I did not build in my pre-thesis final prototype was the “itinerary” feature, but the feedback I received was that this feature could possibly be one of the most important features of this application. Often times, there is a lot of planning involved for a person with a disability to go to a specific place. Claire suggested that to create a minimum viable product including this feature could involve the user simply saving the itinerary to their calendar (iphone, google, etc.). Once it’s saved to their calendar, they can share their itinerary with other people (by “inviting” other attendees).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="grid-60 mobile-grid-100">
          <p>Using Claire’s advice, I spoke to my mom to get an understanding of what her specific needs are when she is going to a specific place. This is what I have narrowed it down to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Ramps: </b>Are ramps available? Is it steep? Does the ramp have railings?</li>
            <li><b>Doors: </b>What type of door? Automatic? Push/pull? Sliding? Revolving? Is it heavy? Is it too hard to open for an able-bodied person? Is there a handicap accessible push button?</li>
            <li><b>Handicap Accessible Bathrooms: </b>Number of stalls? Location of the stall (i.e. in the back)? Toilet height? Railings? Automatic flush?</li>
            <li><b>Aisles/Space: </b> If it's a restaurant, are the aisles wide enough to maneuver a walker/wheelchair?</li>
            <li><b>Floor: </b> Is it easy to walk on? Is it slippery? Is it carpeted?</li>
            <li><b>Handicap Parking Spots: </b> How many are there? Are they close to the location you are trying to go to?</li>
            <li><b>Elevator Access:</b> Is there elevator access? Is it easy to get to the elevator?</li>
            <li><b>Stairs (non-wheelchair user):</b> Do the stairs have railings?</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <p>I was out of town over the weekend, but during my free time, I spent some time brainstorming the list of features I'd like to include in my application. To do that, I wanted to review the different datasets that are available. The data is the most important part of my application - the data should include the accessible locations and then I’ll use the Google Maps API to create the guided “accessible” route.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I reviewed the Access Earth API - It isn’t very large; 4828 data sets total; out of those 788 are for the state of New York.</li>
          <li>Google Maps API: I spent some time trying to understand the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Maps API (JS)</a></li>
          <li>I came across this as well: <a href="https://news.wheelmap.org/en/faq/" target="_blank">wheelmap.org</a>. I have not reviewed the API/data sets on this site yet, but I will take a look in the next few days. I think I will be relying mostly on the Access Earth API and the Google Maps API.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features Brainstorm</h3>
        <p>I drew a mindmap to brainstorm the list of features I would like to have in my app. Since developing ALL of the features for this app is not feasible in one semester (~ a month), I have decided to narrow it down. For version 1, I want to include:</p>
        <div class="grid-50 mobile-grid-100">
          <ul>
            <li>Start with just accessible restaurants (the other options: shopping, coffee, etc. can be added later)</li>
            <li>The step-by-step guided route will provide directions using the Google Maps API and show accessible entrances.</li>
            <li>The favorites option will be a "nice to have" and something I will include if there is time, but most likely it will be added to version 2.</li>
            <li>Finally, the "itinerary" seemed like an important feature based on feedback from my pre-thesis final presentation. So, I would really like to include this if it’s not too complicated to develop.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>This Past Week</h2>
        <p>This past week, I spent some time reviewing my pre-thesis research and pre-thesis final project. I began to list out the different features that I want in the app. As it stands, the app is too broad. Ideally, I’d like for it to be global, but that’s too much to complete in one semester. So, I am thinking about just focusing on NYC and may even narrow it down even further – maybe just a borough (something I will be discussing with my thesis advisor next week). 
          <br><br>

          Since I have front-end development experience, I am not too worried about creating the application, but I have minimal experience building databases. Finding/acquiring accurate datasets and building the database will be my biggest coding challenge for this project. However, the thing I will probably struggle with the most is writing the thesis paper. I am glad that we have very specific deadlines for writing this semester. It is definitely something I would have neglected otherwise.

          <h2>What is your research question?</h2>
          <p>How can we empower people with disabilities to go out and explore new places in NYC?</p>

          <h2>What is the context?</h2>
          <p>The Let’s Go application will be a digital tool that will provide accessible information in one central location that allows a person with a disability to plan out their day with detailed manageable and accessible navigation, activities and events. This information is often not easily available in one central place. Hence, this one application will enable people with disabilities to do the activities they want to do more efficiently. More importantly, this application will be created with an “accessibility-first” design mindset.</p>

          <h2>How will you achieve this project by the end of April?</h2>
          <p>I have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/142MeVaJ1go9HXPdmXRUK7yoeJhViw0IUUGvCHiDmF8A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project timeline</a> that will be regularly updated. I also have a Trello board that I will be using for specific development tasks, user research and user testing.</p>
          <p>Here is a rough timeline:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Jan 25th - Feb 1st:</b> Review of Pre-Thesis Research and Project</li>
              <li><b>Feb 2nd - Feb 8th:</b> Come up with milestones and tasks for the final project. </li>
              <li><b>Feb 2nd - Feb 10th:</b> Additional research - speak to users, reading, database development</li>
              <li><b>Feb 11th - Feb 25th:</b> Coding/development, iterations, additional research and writing outline</li>
              <li><b>Feb 26th - March 5th:</b> Iterations based on user feedback &amp;  advisor feedback; Redrafting paper outline</li>

        <div class="clear"></div>
        Next Steps (for now):
        <ul>
          <li>Finish compiling the list of features and break them down into tasks (Trello)</li>
          <li>The app needs to be accessible to all people with a disability. I will refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and 508 compliance guidelines while I am developing my project. I need to include the guidelines as part of my development tasks.</li>
          <li>With the help of my thesis advisor, I will speak to more users (for additional research)</li>
          <li>Research and speak to my advisor about getting accurate datasets for my database (i.e. Google Maps API, <a href="http://www.accesstogether.org/" target="_blank">Access Together’s API</a>, etc.)</li>
          <li>Schedule weekly meetings with my accountability partner</li>
