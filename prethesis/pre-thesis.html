          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>I was surprised that I only uncovered a moderate amount of research (articles, presentations, videos) surrounding accessible smart home technology. Most of the information I found was specifically for the "aging market". I would have expected to find articles that drew connections between accessible technology that was designed for people with disabilities (such as, text messaging), which is so profoundly simple, in retrospect, could end up revolutionizing how human beings interact and communicate on a daily basis. Text messaging was originally designed for people who are deaf. It is a far more popular and widely-used medium of communication than the phone and email in 2016. In Elise Roy’s Ted Talk, "When we design for disability, we all benefit", her main theme was “design for disability first.” This principle makes sense; if companies designed their products with enhancing use for disabled people, then they are starting their product development cycle with a complete addressable market. But why is that companies do not design with this principle in mind?
            <br>
            Another factor that comes into play is the cost of assistive technology. Due to the low demand and the amount of work that goes into developing this technology, it becomes difficult to keep costs down. However, if accessibility is incorporated into the original design of technology, then "additional" assistive technology is not necessary.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p><a href="http://www.worldfooddayusa.org/food_waste_the_facts" target="_blank">"In the USA, 30-40% of the food supply is wasted, equaling more than 20 pounds of food per person per month."</a> 
            <br>Food waste is clearly a deeply-rooted problem in the United States. Upon learning more information about the extent of the food waste problem. I was struck that it has remained an issue for many years, and easy solutions have not yet been implemented at scale to help alleviate the issue. Cities and States have laws about recycling, but why aren't there laws or at least initiatives that help people recognize the need to recycle food nation wide? The "cure" to food waste -- consuming less, or donating food that would otherwise be wasted -- is much like recycling plastic bottles, paper, cans, and glass. This is clearly a complicated problem with no easy solution(s) but I am interested in learning more about what solutions using technology have been identified and leveraged at a micro scale, for possible use on a larger scale. 
            <br> 
            What new innovative ideas can reduce and prevent food waste? How can we better monitor food wastage in homes? How can we encourage better consumption habits (especially in developed countries)?

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Official statistics collected from the FBI indicate that the level of hate crimes has remained the same in recent years. The fact that such crimes have not gone down is interesting, especially given the wide-spread coverage of such incidents and tough enforcement from the local, state, and federal level around investigation and prosuection. <br> Upon reading more about hate crimes, I started to wonder why this level of "hate" or intolerance against certain groups exists in the United States, compared to other Western and well-developed nations that experience only a fraction of the problem?</p>

          <!-- First Prototype -->
          <h3> Concept 1.1.1: Case Study - Visit Hotels and View Accessible Rooms</h3>
          <h4><a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycbk-new-york-marriott-at-the-brooklyn-bridge/">Marriott Hotel at the Brooklyn Bridge</a></h4>
          <p>The hotel rooms I viewed at Marriott varied. Some had double beds and others had king size beds. The bathrooms also varied - some had tubs and others had roll-in showers. Most of the rooms also had adjoining rooms with the intention that a person with disabilities might want to have access to another person(s).</p>
          <p>What was interesting was that the manager told me that there only about 20 handicap accessible rooms - out of <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/nycbk-new-york-marriott-at-the-brooklyn-bridge/">665 rooms</a>. Only some of them had easy access to the elevator - others had a long walk down a hallway to get to and from the room. Finally, there is only one handicap accessible room in the entire hotel that has a view.</p>

          <div class="clear"></div>

          <h4><a href="www.aloftnewyorkbrooklyn.com">Aloft Hotel - New York Brooklyn</a></h4>
          <p>Aloft only has 3 or 4 handicap accessible rooms out of 175. All of these rooms are on lower floors in case of an emergency - it's easier to get down to the lobby. As such, they don't have any views. All of the rooms are king rooms and they "accidently" get booked by non-disabled people who request a king size bed. The overall space of the rooms are smaller (compared to Marriott rooms).</p>

          <h4><a href="http://www.sheratonbrooklyn.com/">Sheraton Brooklyn New York Hotel</a></h4>
          <p>For Sheraton - out of 321 rooms, only 10 rooms are accessible. All the rooms are located near an elevator on lower floors (no views). They have both king and double bed rooms. They have adjoining rooms. Some of the bathrooms have tubs and others have roll-in showers. What was interesting about this shower is the the shower curtain didn't go all the way down and the shower area was flat with the ground (no separation, no indentation of any sort). When I asked about they prevent the rest of the bathroom from getting wet, she said, we can provide extra towels - this did not seem like a good solution because wet towels for a person with a disability is just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than a wet floor.</p>

          <h3> Concept (1.2.2) Create a Personalized Ring Tone</h3>

          <!-- 3rd Prototype -->
          <h3> Concept (1.3.2) Paper Prototype an Uber Style App for Health Aids</h3>

          <p>The idea for this "app" is that a person with disabilities can request a health aid on demand. He or she can request this person for a specific number of hours or days. They can request a male or female that may speak another language (i.e. Spanish). This is just an initial sketch of what the app will do, but I would like to incorporate access to google maps telling the user where their health aid is (similar to Uber) and what time they will be arriving. The user should be able to link their calendar to the app so they can request an aid in advance or request one for present time.</p>

                  The CareLinx platform helps families and caregivers easily manage all the administrative tasks of their caregiving needs, including scheduling, time tracking, care coordination and payroll processing."</td>
                  <td>This service provides full-time caregivers to the users. For my app idea (Aid on Demand), I want to provide the user with a caregiver for small, menial tasks/chores. Also, my concept is more of an "uber" style service, where the user can request an aid that will show up maybe the day of for these tasks. I think the model of my concept is probably more like TaskRabbit.</td>
